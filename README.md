A sample program showing basic threading in Qt.

This program shows how a UI can generate a worker thread which does some 'intense' process without sacrificing UI response time. To use the program do the following:

1. Enter a number.
2. Press enter. 
3. The number you entered will be the starting variable that then increments infinitely. Pressing enter again without changing the original seed number will simply retrieve the latest value generated by the worker thread. Entering a different value will stop the worker thread and restart it at the new value.
